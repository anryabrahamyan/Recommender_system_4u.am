## Recommendation system Testing

First of all you need to fetch and download content from our remote repository with

```python 
git pull
```

Then change your directory to Recommender_system_4u.am/

```python 
cd  Recommender_system_4u.am/
```


Then you need to get the scraped data with 
```python 
python src/scraper.py
```

Then in order to 
- clean the data,
- download the images into a new directory (images), 
- put the vectorized product names, descriptions and images into the corresponding .npy files in the data directory 

```python 
python src/create_recommendation_dataset.py
```

Finally to get the recommended 5 products for each product

```python 
python src/recommender.py
```


(In the recommender.py’s main function the product for which you’ll get the recommendations is the first product in our 
data, in order to change it, just put your desired number(0-296) instead of 0 in

```python 
print(rec.predict(0)) 
```
